Front: make target audience a check box


- take the union of age ranges and filter the users using the new range 

- edge case ان شاء الله ماتحصلش: if the advertiser chose discontainous range we will have more the one range to filter by.

- set limit words for description and campaign name

- if number of images > number of inseted video links
>>> the remiander video could set as a string (the title of video on youtube)
>>> or let the advertise insert the wanted title for each video and separate them form images

- set a defaul image (campany logo) for the campaign don't link it with a video 

Future work: suggest campaign name based on the description (use NLP model XD)


--------- Edit campaign ----------
Front: All fields will be filled with the old data and mave the save button disabled until detecting any change
